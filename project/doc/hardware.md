## Pycom expansionboard 3.1 and USB cable 
To connect lopy4 to coputer, for programming, via USB, in addition to USB-cable, we use a pycom expantionbord which is compatible with lopy4.

## LoRa antenna
To send data from sensors via ```LoRa (868MHz/915MHz)``` and because of using lopy4 as IOT dvelopment board we use the universal LoRa & Sigfox Antenna Kit, external antenna.

## Pir HC-SR501 sensor (Passive infrared sensor):
Pir motion sensor that senses the heat by measuring infrared (IR) light from objects like humans and animals. It's output is "high" or "low", in other words it does not give data or information about the direction.

## DHT 11:  
DHT is a digital sensor which measure temperature and humidity.   
The sensor communicates using the 1-Wire protocol, therfore we need to use a library.
