# General requirements:

## Sensors:
1. DTH11 sensor: to measure temperature and humidity from the birdhouse at a specific time of the day. 
2. Motion sensors: to reveal the bird's motion through the hole of the birdhouse.

## Lora: 
* There is no connection to Wifi in Kalmar-d√§mmet, therefore signals and data should be sent via Lora (Long Range) instead of wifi. 

## Battery powered:
* Instead of electricity, so pycom can be able to work.


# Requirements for the product:
- The data is sent in as real-time as possible. 
- The project can work outset and it should not disturb birds.
- Visualize different data with graphs.
